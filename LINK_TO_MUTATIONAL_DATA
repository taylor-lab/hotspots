The first 34 columns are standard MAF format, and described here:

https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/eJaPAQ

Subsequent columns include:

35. HGVSc - the coding sequence of the variant in HGVS recommended format
36. HGVSp - the protein sequence of the variant in HGVS recommended format
37. HGVSp_Short - Same as HGVSp, but using 1-letter amino-acid codes
38. Transcript_ID - transcript onto which the consequence of the variant has been mapped
39. Exon_Number - the exon number (out of total number)
40. t_depth - read depth across this locus in tumor BAM
41. t_ref_count - read depth supporting the reference allele in tumor BAM
42. t_alt_count - read depth supporting the variant allele in tumor BAM
43. n_depth - read depth across this locus in normal BAM
44. n_ref_count - read depth supporting the reference allele in normal BAM
45. n_alt_count - read depth supporting the variant allele in normal BAM

The next column is relevant to analyses that consider the effect of the variant on all alternate
isoforms of the gene, or on non-coding/regulatory transcripts. The effects are sorted first by
transcript biotype priority, then by effect severity, and finally by decreasing order of transcript
length. Each effect in the list is in the format [SYMBOL,Consequence,HGVSp,Transcript_ID,RefSeq].

46. all_effects - a semicolon delimited list of all possible variant effects, sorted by priority
